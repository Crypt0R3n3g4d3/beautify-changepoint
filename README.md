# Beautify Changepoint

Lets make Changepoint Look and Behave like a modern application. A few tweeks could save Tyler employees 10s to 100s of hours a week. This could equate to thousands of hours.

## Goals

1. Create MVP of awesome CSS and JS that makes changepoint look great
1. Optimize a little and repeat step 1
1. Create a chrome extension that applies the CSS and JS
